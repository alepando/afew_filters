This is a collection of filters for use with [afew][], a post-fetch
tagging tool that works with [notmuch][].

To use these filters, copy them into `~/.config/afew/`.

Note that at the moment these will only work with my [forked version
of afew][larsks] due to some missing functionality in the original
version.
